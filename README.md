Sure! Here's a complete `README.md` file in proper GitHub Markdown format for your Flask-based melanoma classifier app using an ONNX model:


# 🧬 Melanoma Classifier Web App

A simple Flask web application for classifying skin lesions as **Benign** or **Malignant** using a pre-trained ONNX model.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload an image of a skin lesion.
- Processes and classifies the image using a deep learning model in ONNX format.
- Returns the prediction (`Benign` or `Malignant`) via a web interface.
- Lightweight and easy to deploy locally.

## 🧠 Model Info

This app uses an ONNX model named `melanoma_classifier.onnx` trained for binary classification:
- **0** → Benign
- **1** → Malignant

The model expects input images resized to 224x224 and normalized accordingly.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install flask onnxruntime pillow torchvision numpy
```

## 📂 Project Structure

```

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User accesses the homepage (`/`) and uploads an image.
2. The image is preprocessed using `torchvision` transforms:
   - Resize to 224x224
   - Convert to tensor and normalize
3. The image is passed to the ONNX model using `onnxruntime`.
4. A prediction is returned and displayed on the frontend as either:
   - ✅ Benign
   - ⚠️ Malignant

## 💻 Running the App

1. Clone this repo or copy the files to your machine.
2. Make sure your environment is set up with the dependencies above.
3. Run the Flask app:

```bash
python app.py
```

4. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
